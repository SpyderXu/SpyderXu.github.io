## 徐传智(ChuanzhiXu)

I am a graduate student in Automation Department of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I major in computer vision and interested in object detection, tracking and segmentation. I have received my bachelor degree in Huazhong University of Science and Techonology from 2013.09 to 2017.06.

Here are some links about me:

* [Github](https://github.com/SpyderXu) : Some source codes and paper list.
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/chuanzhixu) : Some object detection and segmentation challenges which I took part in.
* [Leetcode](https://leetcode-cn.com/u/spyderxu/) : Some algorithm problems I practice to improve my poor program skills.

Here are some skills about me:

* Program Language : C/C++、 Python、 Matlab
* Deep Learning Framework : Caffe、 Pytorch
* CV Open Source Library : OpenCV、 OpenVino

Here are my familiar areas about CV:

* Object detection : 2D object detection or Monocular 3D object detection.
* Tracking : Multi-object Tracking or Single-object Tracking.
* Trajectory prediciton.
* Traditional image processing and computer vision algorithms.
* Traditional pattern recognition algorithms.
* Instance segmentation and Pose estimation (just a little).
