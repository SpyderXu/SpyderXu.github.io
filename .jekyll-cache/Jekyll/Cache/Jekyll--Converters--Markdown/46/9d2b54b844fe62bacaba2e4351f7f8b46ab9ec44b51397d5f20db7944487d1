<p>I am a graduate student in Automation Department of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I major in computer vision and interested in object detection, tracking and segmentation. I have received my bachelor degree in Huazhong University of Science and Techonology from 2013.09 to 2017.06.</p>

<p>Here are some links about me:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/SpyderXu">Github</a> : Some source codes and paper list.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/chuanzhixu">Kaggle</a> : Some object detection and segmentation challenges which I took part in.</li>
  <li><a href="https://leetcode-cn.com/u/spyderxu/">Leetcode</a> : Some algorithm problems I practice to improve my poor program skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some skills about me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Program Language : C/C++、 Python、 Matlab</li>
  <li>Deep Learning Framework : Caffe、 Pytorch</li>
  <li>CV Open Source Library : OpenCV、 OpenVino</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are my familiar areas about CV:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Object detection : 2D object detection or Monocular 3D object detection.</li>
  <li>Tracking : Multi-object Tracking or Single-object Tracking.</li>
  <li>Traditional image processing and computer vision algorithms.</li>
  <li>Trajectory prediciton.</li>
  <li>Instance segmentation and Pose estimation (just a little).</li>
</ul>
